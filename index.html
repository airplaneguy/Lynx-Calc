    <h1>🔥 INTRODUCING THE FIRSTLYNX CALCULATOR – BECAUSE DECODING FIRSTLYNX TAKES MATH! 🔥</h1>
    <p>Have you ever asked Firstlynx to do something, only to receive a vague, cryptic response like <em>“I’ll add it soon”</em> or <em>“eventually”</em>? Have you struggled to convert these mysterious phrases into real-world time? Well, struggle no more!</p>

    <p>With the <strong>Firstlynx Calculator™</strong>, you can finally translate his legendary phrases into ACTUAL wait times! Here’s the current data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“I’ll add it soon”</strong> → Estimated time: <em>2 months ⏳</em></li>
      <li><strong>“Eventually”</strong> → Expected wait: <em>4 weeks 📆</em></li>
      <li><strong>“Just be patient”</strong> → Reality: <em>Could be anywhere from 3 months to never</em></li>
      <li><strong>“Fixing it now”</strong> → Translation: <em>Check back next year</em></li>
      <li><strong>“idk”</strong> → <em>He knows. He just doesn’t want to disappoint you with his answer.</em></li>
      <li><strong>💔 (Heartbroken emoji)</strong> → <em>He has ignored your DM or is deeply disappointed in you. You will never recover.</em></li>
      <li><strong>🥀 (Withering rose emoji)</strong> → <em>You have waited too long. Hope is dead. What you want from Firstlynx is no longer coming.</em></li>
      <li><strong>“I’ll do it tomorrow”</strong> → Translation: <em>Usually takes 5–8 business days</em></li>
      <li><strong>“No”</strong> → Actually means: <em>Maybe.</em></li>
      <li><strong>“Yes”</strong> → Secret translation: <em>No.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Never be confused again! With the <strong>Firstlynx Calculator™</strong>, you’ll always know when to actually expect things—or when to give up hope. Either works.</p>
